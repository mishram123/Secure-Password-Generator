# Secure-Password-Generator
Interactive Java program to create and store secure passwords

With the number of hackers roaming the internet, having a secure password has never been more necessary. In an attempt to boost security, websites, banks, and even schools require users to change their password every few months. But how does one creatively generate new, secure passwords and remember them every time?

For this reason, I decided to create a secure password generator. This program will interact with the user asking them how many passwords they want to make, ask them to label the passwords, and then prompt them through a series of parameters to generate passwords.

Then the program will assign each password to its intended label and export a .txt file containing the passwords and their appropriate label. This way, the user can always store their passwords in a secure text file without having to memorize them.
